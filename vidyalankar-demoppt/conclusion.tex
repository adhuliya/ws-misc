  \frametitle{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Exposing the relevant information of analyses can provide the needed tools to harness mutually beneficial interaction automatically.

        \item Our current approach performs better than other known approaches. (w.r.t. to the finite explorations we did)

        \item This work has just started and there are a lot of things yet to be done.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Future Work}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Test the proposed system with analyses other than Constant Propagation, Class Analysis, Liveness Analysis, and Pointer Analysis.

    \item Formalize the still intuitive workings of the system.

    \item Prove the soundness and termination criteria.

    \item Compare its precision with other known techniques.

    \item Can it work at an inter-procedural level.

    \item Experiment with the model of the system to achieve better precision.

    \item Implement the system once it is finalized and formalized sufficiently.
\end{enumerate}
