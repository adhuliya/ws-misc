# Useful Snippets

Useful snippets for reference and reusability.


This is a collection of programs that demonstrate the
usage of useful tools in one place. The attempt is to
make them as useful out of the box as possible.

This folder has its own custom `.gitignore` file.


To test or invoke a specific module
like `snippets.data_formats.csv` do
make sure package `snippets` is in your
path and invoke,

    python3 -m snippets.data_formats.csv
