RIMINET 2.0
===========

This is the revised, more modularized, experiment friendly version of RIMINET 1.0 that was developed as part of my M.Tech thesis at IIIT Allahabad, India.

This project is an attempt to take a shot at how learning could be implemented using few simple rules. Its like an artificial life simulation. It stands against the use of mathematically extensive field of Machine Learning that is as good as writing intelligent algorithms where the intelligence is with the programmer and not the system. I am not sure of how successful this system would be in its current form, but I expect it to lay the foundation of future versions that can do much more.
