\noindent{}Dear Sir,

\noindent{}I am a PhD scholar, residing in MRSB/Manas Building, Flat 605. Recently, pigeons tripped a clay pot in the toilet which has broken off a chunk of the toilet seat. The image of which is attached.

\noindent{}There has been a delay in writing this letter as this is my APS month.
