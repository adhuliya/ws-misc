This document describes how to include the code and lists (nested) into the document:

* This is the first list item
* This item contains a code block to demonstrate ``echo``
  
        $ echo "hello world"
        hello world
* this should have a nested list

        $ cat hello.txt
        hello
    * the list here 1
    * the list here 2

            $ cat hello.txt
            hello
* the next list item

* [`hello`](https://www.google.com/)
